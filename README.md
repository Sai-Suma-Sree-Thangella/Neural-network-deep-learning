# Neural-network-deep-learning 
SHORT DESCRIPTION :
I have totally used join,replace, ifelif, split, pop, reverse methods to complete the assignment. repalce() is used to replace the string which we want to replace. join() is used to join the characters in the list to form a ring. i have used split() method to split the string into several list of characters. i have used pop() to remove the characters which we want to from the end of the list. Here i have used negative index powers because i want to remove the characters from the list at the last. i have used reverse function to reverse the string to get the desired output. I have used input() to get the the input from the user at time of running the code. whenever it is required i have typecasted the input string to get the integer value whenever it is needed in the question.
